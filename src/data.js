        info : "Agra is best known for the Taj Mahal (17th century), designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983. A complex mausoleum, the Taj Mahal is often considered to be the world’s best example of Mughal architecture. The Mughal emperor Shah Jahān built it for his favourite wife, Mumtāz Maḥal, in the mid-17th century. Agra Fort (16th century), called the Red Fort for its massive red sandstone walls, was built by the emperor Akbar; it contains the Pearl Mosque (Moti Masjid; 17th century), constructed of white marble, and a palace, the Jahangiri Mahal. The fort was also designated a World Heritage site in 1983.",

Today, the city is known for its bazaars, forts, temples, palaces, and wildlife sanctuaries. In this Expedition, we explore some of the city’s landmarks and see how religion, culture, and science overlapped to influence the city’s development.",
